# Project 5 - React

## Main Requirements

Uses React, and no jQuery
Uses modular components
Uses axios and/or Firebase
React 'knows' about all DOM changes (bind your inputs!)
this.state is never directly changed because .setState() is always used to alter state
App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop-down menu, search field)
It is clear to the user what the app does
App and interactions are accessible
Errors are handled effectively
Site is live on student's own URL or GitHub Pages

### Also

Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
Semantic HTML elements are used properly
All CSS for the site is written in only one CSS file (no inline styles, no separate CSS files for each component, etc). How you get there is up to you.
Setup snippet is used
Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
Site is responsive and uses media queries
Files and folders share a naming convention.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
